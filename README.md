Lab 9 - Self Assessment

1) This git repository serves as a way for me to upload my work privately so you can see how awesome it is.

2) My favorite assignment in terms of just being fun was 'wedo', because putting the lyrics on a Simpsons music video isn't something you do everyday, but in terms of ACTUALLY coding, I would say Assignment 2, because I liked working with Google Maps, and it helped me learn all the stops on the Red Line.

3) I'm not too sure how much I've 'grown', but I definitely am infinitely more comfortable with front end developement now than I was a few months ago.

4) The most important thing I learned in this course is how to use git and github WELL. Before this course, I was always aware of how to read, download, and do spectator type things on github, but I never had an active role in using it. Honestly, using git seems just so practical, and I don't know why this is the first CS course I've taken that requires using it. Two sources (I guess?) of using git are my git repository itself and my group project that uses a heroku app.

5) First and foremost, I'm a math guy (Math/CS double major). That kind of means I'm more drawn to the algorithmic part of computer science, so naturally I'm going to use more of those kinds of classes to fill out most of my CS breadth electives. However, I actually am pretty interested in security; when I was younger my Dad liked to show me things he was able to 'break in to', and preteen me was always pretty intruiged by it. I think taking a class or two on that kind of stuff would be super interesting, so don't be surprised if you see me in COMP50 in a later semester!
